"Memory is the reactivation of a specific group of neurons, formed from persistent changes in the strength of connections between neurons [...] Active connections tend to get stronger, 
whereas those that arenâ€™t used get weaker and can eventually disappear entirely..." - The University of Queensland Australia


**Failure State**

It used to be beautiful. 

The roots used to connect.

Everything had a place.

Then everything shattered...

The ground up heaved.

The roots broke.

I can't find them as easily...

I thought there used to be more...

**Winning State**

It used to be beautiful.

The roots used to connect.

Everything had a place.

Then everything shattered...

The ground up heaved.

The roots broke.

I can reconnect them...

Until it is beautiful once again...
